Going back to Japan is not so easy thing for me. Actually Japan is the my mother country and my first language is Japanese, and my body and I love Japanese food and environment including incredible hot summar. However, it does not necessarily mean that I would like to go back to Japane, in particular to this timing.

I came here about 3 and half years ago. Before I came here, I had a lot of things which I wanted to experience, learn, and study.
